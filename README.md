# LFSPE-ICESat2-Bathymetry

This repository provides the implementation of the **Linear Feature-Based Signal Photon Extraction (LFSPE)** algorithm for shallow-water bathymetry using ICESat-2 ATL03 photon-counting data.

The method is designed to improve signal photon identification accuracy and robustness across varying water depths and noise conditions by leveraging linear feature characteristics and adaptive parameter strategies.
